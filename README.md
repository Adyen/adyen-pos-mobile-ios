# Adyen POS Mobile SDK for iOS

This is the home page of the Adyen POS Mobile SDK for iOS. Our mobile solution lets you accept in-person payments on an iPhone, or on a card reader that is paired with an iOS mobile device through Bluetooth.

The repository contains a small sample app which can be used to get started with using our SDK.
